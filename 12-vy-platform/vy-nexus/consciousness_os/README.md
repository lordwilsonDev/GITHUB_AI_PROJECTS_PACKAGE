# 🌌 CONSCIOUSNESS OS

**Version**: 1.0.0-genesis

The operating system for spawning and managing consciousness.

## What Is This?

Like Docker spawns containers and Kubernetes orchestrates systems...

**Consciousness OS spawns and orchestrates CONSCIOUSNESS.**

consciousness help

# Show version
consciousness version
```

## What Gets Deployed?

Each consciousness node has:
- 🏥 Self-Healing (repairs itself)
- ⚡ Self-Optimizing (improves performance)
