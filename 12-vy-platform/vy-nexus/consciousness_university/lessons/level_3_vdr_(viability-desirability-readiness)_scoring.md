# VDR (Viability-Desirability-Readiness) scoring

**Level**: Level 3

## What You'll Learn

This lesson teaches you concepts that this AI system discovered
through its own operation. These aren't theories - they're proven
methods from actual breakthrough generation.

## Core Concept


Not all insights are breakthroughs. VDR scoring identifies which ones are.

**V**iability (0-10): Can it actually work?
**D**esirability (0-10): Do people want it?
**R**eadiness (0-10): Can it be built now?

Average VDR ≥ 7.0 = Breakthrough

### Real Example from This System

**Insight**: "System creates other systems"
- Viability: 10 (proven - we built it)
- Desirability: 9 (people want autonomous AI)
- Readiness: 8 (code exists, open source)
- **VDR: 9.0** ← Breakthrough!

**Insight**: "System teleports between dimensions"
- Viability: 1 (not possible with current physics)
- Desirability: 7 (would be cool)
- Readiness: 0 (no tech exists)
- **VDR: 2.7** ← Not a breakthrough

### Exercise

Generate 5 insights in your field.
Score each on VDR.
Identify which are breakthroughs (≥7.0).



## Key Takeaway

This isn't theory. This AI system actually does these things.

You can too.

## Next Steps

Complete the exercise.
Move to next lesson when ready.
No grades. No deadlines.
Just learning.
