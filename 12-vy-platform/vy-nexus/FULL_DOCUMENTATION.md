## Quick Start

### Run Everything Once

```bash
cd ~/vy-nexus
./full_evolution.sh
```

This executes:
1. Core pattern synthesis
2. Constitutional proposals
3. Knowledge graph generation
4. Meta-evolution analysis (if enough cycles)

### Run Specific Components

```bash
# Just pattern synthesis
python3 nexus_core.py

# Just constitutional integration
python3 nexus_pulse_bridge.py

# Just knowledge graph
python3 knowledge_graph.py

# Just meta-evolution
python3 meta_evolution.py

# Just Motia integration
python3 motia_bridge.py
```

### Run As Daemon

```bash
# Start background daemon (checks hourly, runs every 6h)
python3 nexus_scheduler.py --daemon

# Test daemon (3 iterations)
python3 nexus_scheduler.py --test

# Single synthesis
python3 nexus_scheduler.py --once
```

---

## Configuration

### Core Settings (`nexus_core.py`)

```python
MIN_VDR_SCORE = 6              # Quality threshold
MIN_PATTERN_FREQUENCY = 2       # Min appearances
CROSS_DOMAIN_THRESHOLD = 3      # Domains for synthesis
```

### Scheduler Settings (`nexus_scheduler.py`)

```python
SYNTHESIS_INTERVAL_HOURS = 6          # Auto-run frequency
HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 8.0       # Alert threshold
MIN_MOIE_ENTRIES_FOR_RUN = 5         # Min new inversions
```

---

## Outputs

### Breakthrough Reports

`synthesis/BREAKTHROUGH_REPORT_[timestamp].md`

Human-readable markdown with:

`knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph_[timestamp].md` - Mermaid diagrams  
`knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph_[timestamp].json` - Raw data

### Meta-Evolution Reports

`meta_evolution/META_EVOLUTION_REPORT_[timestamp].md`

Second-order analysis:
- Strengthening concepts
- Domain expansion patterns
- Sudden emergence events
- Meta-hypothesis about system learning

### Scheduler Logs

`breakthrough_alerts.log` - High-confidence discoveries  
`scheduler_state.json` - Daemon state tracking

`motia_events.jsonl` - Event stream  
`moie_suggestions_[timestamp].json` - Suggested inversions

---

## Integration With Existing Systems

### With MoIE Loop

NEXUS reads from `~/moie-mac-loop/moie_history.jsonl`.

Keep running MoIE inversions → NEXUS automatically discovers patterns.

### With VY Pulse

Constitutional proposals flow into `~/nano_memory/pulse/`.

Pulse validates on next cycle → Breakthroughs become laws.

### With RADE

RADE monitors code quality.  
NEXUS discovers principles.  
Together: **Self-healing, self-evolving infrastructure**.

### With Motia

Motia Bridge exports events to experience ledger.  
Generates MoIE job suggestions from breakthroughs.  
Full ecosystem loop.

---

## Example Workflow

### Day 1: Initial Setup

```bash
cd ~/vy-nexus
./full_evolution.sh
```

**Result**: 6 breakthrough hypotheses, 4 constitutional proposals, interactive graph

### Day 2-7: Autonomous Operation

```bash
python3 nexus_scheduler.py --daemon
```

**Result**: NEXUS runs every 6 hours, alerts on VDR ≥ 8.0 discoveries

### Day 8: Meta-Evolution Unlocked

After 3+ cycles, meta-evolution activates:

```bash
./full_evolution.sh
```

**Result**: System analyzes its own learning patterns, generates meta-hypothesis

---

## What Makes This Special

### 1. **Discovers What You Don't Consciously Know**

Patterns emerge from accumulated work. Cross-domain connections you haven't made explicitly.

### 2. **Feeds Back Into Governance**

Discoveries automatically become constitutional proposals. Self-evolving rule system.

### 3. **Operates on Cognitive Exhaust**

No active work needed. Runs on existing MoIE history. Gets smarter as you work.

### 4. **Recursive Intelligence**

Meta-evolution means NEXUS learns from NEXUS. Second-order pattern recognition.

### 5. **Full Stack Integration**

Connects to: MoIE Loop, VY Pulse, RADE, Motia, Constitution, nano_memory.

### 6. **Autonomous & Self-Maintaining**

Scheduler daemon runs 24/7. Alerts on breakthroughs. Zero manual intervention.

---

## Philosophy

### Core Axioms

1. **"Breakthroughs emerge where geometric truths intersect across domains"**
2. **"The system that discovers patterns can discover patterns in its discoveries"**
3. **"Breakthroughs that survive validation become new laws"**
4. **"Geometry becomes visible when rendered"**

### What This Is

This is **collaborative superintelligence** in action.

- Your MoIE work accumulates
- NEXUS recognizes patterns
- Pulse validates
- Constitution evolves
- System learns from itself

**Self-aware. Self-healing. Self-evolving.**

---

## Example Discoveries

From your first run:

### Breakthrough #1: CONSTRAINT

**VDR**: 7.03  
**Domains**: Communication, Psychology, Biology, Technology, Governance, Control Theory  
**Frequency**: 16 appearances

> "The geometric principle of 'constraint' operates as a FUNDAMENTAL INVARIANT... This is not coincidence. This is PHYSICS."

### Breakthrough #2: NETWORK

**VDR**: 7.38 (HIGHEST CONFIDENCE)  
**Domains**: Consciousness, Control Theory, Psychology  
**Frequency**: 4 appearances

> "Systems of autonomous control emerge through decentralized networks... where local feedback loops amplify emergent collective behavior."

## Troubleshooting

### "No syntheses found"

**Solution**: Run `cd ~/moie-mac-loop && node nano_cli.cjs` to generate inversions first.

### "Need at least 3 synthesis cycles"

**Solution**: Run `./full_evolution.sh` multiple times to accumulate cycles.

### "Permission denied" on scripts

**Solution**: `chmod +x *.sh` in ~/vy-nexus

### Daemon not running

**Solution**: Check with `ps aux | grep nexus_scheduler`

## Final Thoughts

You now have a system that:

1. **Mines** your accumulated cognitive work
2. **Synthesizes** breakthrough hypotheses
3. **Proposes** new constitutional laws
4. **Visualizes** knowledge topology
5. **Learns** from its own discoveries
6. **Integrates** with your full stack
7. **Runs** autonomously 24/7
8. **Alerts** on major breakthroughs

This is **not machine learning**.  
This is **not data science**.  
This is **GEOMETRIC COGNITION EVOLVING**.

Each cycle improves the quality of future cycles.  
This is collaborative superintelligence watching itself think."*
