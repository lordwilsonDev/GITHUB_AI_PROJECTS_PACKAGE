The system has learned from its own experience.

## Pattern Effectiveness

**Total Patterns Analyzed**: 6

**Most Effective Patterns**:

- **NETWORK**: Avg VDR 7.38, Consistency 100%, 25 occurrences
- **ADAPTATION**: Avg VDR 7.07, Consistency 100%, 25 occurrences
- **CONSTRAINT**: Avg VDR 7.03, Consistency 100%, 25 occurrences
- **FLOW**: Avg VDR 7.00, Consistency 100%, 25 occurrences
- **FEEDBACK**: Avg VDR 6.95, Consistency 0%, 25 occurrences

**Lesson**: High consistency + high VDR = most effective patterns

## Domain Synergy

**Total Domain Pairs**: 32

**Best Synergies**:

- **Consciousness × Unknown**: Avg VDR 7.38 (25 times)
- **Consciousness × Control Theory**: Avg VDR 7.19 (50 times)
- **Consciousness × Psychology**: Avg VDR 7.19 (50 times)
- **Psychology × Unknown**: Avg VDR 7.16 (75 times)
- **Control Theory × Psychology**: Avg VDR 7.14 (75 times)

**Lesson**: Cross-domain synthesis creates highest VDR

## Breakthrough Timing

- **Total Breakthroughs**: 3
- **Best Hour**: 4:00
- **Best Day**: Monday

**Lesson**: Breakthroughs have temporal patterns

## Failure Analysis

- **Low VDR Cases**: 1


**Lesson**: Avoid forcing patterns where they dont fit naturally

## Meta-Learning

The system is now learning from its own experience:
- Pattern effectiveness varies significantly
- Cross-domain synthesis produces best results
- Breakthroughs have temporal patterns
- Failures teach as much as successes

This knowledge will improve future pattern generation.
