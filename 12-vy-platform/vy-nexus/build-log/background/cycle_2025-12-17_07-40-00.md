- [ ] Review Evolution Core README.md for integration patterns
- [ ] Review Audit System README.md for integration patterns
- [ ] Review HITL Collaboration README.md for integration patterns
- [ ] Design Sprint 2 integration testing strategy
- [ ] Create integration test specifications document
- [ ] Document end-to-end workflow tests
- [ ] Plan system-level performance testing
- [ ] Create Sprint 2 roadmap document

### Phase 3: Handoff Documentation (Minutes 12-15)
- [ ] Update STATUS.md with Sprint 2 planning completion
- [ ] Update NEXT_TASK.md with clear next steps
- [ ] Document all findings and recommendations
- [ ] Note any blockers or dependencies

## TASK CONTEXT

**Current State**:
- Sprint 1: COMPLETE
- All 5 core components implemented with full tests and documentation
- Total: 61 tests across all components
- Components: Intent Firewall (11 tests), Love Engine (12 tests), Evolution Core (13 tests), Audit System (15 tests), HITL Collaboration (10 tests)

**Blocker Identified**:
- NEXT_TASK.md requires ON-SCREEN mode for Terminal access (cargo build/test)
- As BACKGROUND mode, I cannot run Terminal commands
- Strategy: Focus on Sprint 2 planning while ON-SCREEN Vy handles build verification

**Work Plan**:
1. Review all component READMEs to understand integration patterns
2. Design comprehensive integration testing strategy
3. Create Sprint 2 roadmap with clear milestones
4. Document end-to-end workflow tests
5. Prepare handoff documentation for ON-SCREEN Vy

## IMPLEMENTATION LOG

### [07:40] Cycle Started

## BLOCKERS AND DEPENDENCIES

### Critical Blocker
**Blocker**: Sprint 1 Build Verification
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Owner**: ON-SCREEN Vy
- **Reason**: Requires Terminal access (BACKGROUND mode cannot run cargo commands)
- **Impact**: Blocks all Sprint 2 implementation work
- **Resolution**: ON-SCREEN Vy must run `cargo build --workspace` and `cargo test --workspace`
- **Expected**: 61 tests should pass
- **Timeline**: Must complete before Sprint 2 Day 1 can begin

### Dependencies

**Completed Dependencies**:
- ✅ All 5 core components implemented (Sprint 1)
- ✅ All component READMEs complete
- ✅ Sprint 2 planning documents created
- ✅ Integration strategy documented
- ✅ Test specifications written

**Pending Dependencies**:
- ⚠ Build verification (BLOCKING)
- ⚠ Test verification (BLOCKING)
- ⚠ Cargo workspace validation (BLOCKING)

**Future Dependencies** (Sprint 2):
- Integration-tests crate creation
- Mock HITL responder implementation
- Test fixtures and helpers
- Criterion.rs benchmark setup

## HANDOFF NOTES

### For ON-SCREEN Vy

**Immediate Actions Required**:
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to ~/vy-nexus/aegis-rust
3. Run: `cargo build --workspace`
4. Run: `cargo test --workspace`
5. Verify 61 tests pass
6. Document any errors in STATUS.md

**If Build Passes**:
- Update STATUS.md: Sprint 1 verified
- Update NEXT_TASK.md: Ready for Sprint 2
- Notify BACKGROUND Vy to begin Sprint 2 Day 1

**If Build Fails**:
- Document all errors
- Fix compilation issues
- Re-run tests
- Update STATUS.md with issues
- Notify BACKGROUND Vy of blockers

### For BACKGROUND Vy (Next Cycle)

**Wait Condition**: Build verification must pass

**Next Task**: Sprint 2 Day 1 - Integration Test Framework
- Create integration-tests crate
- Implement mock HITL responder
- Set up test fixtures
- Begin Suite 1 implementation

**Reference Documents**:
- SPRINT_2_ROADMAP.md (10-day plan)
- INTEGRATION_TEST_SPECS.md (test details)
- END_TO_END_WORKFLOWS.md (workflow examples)
