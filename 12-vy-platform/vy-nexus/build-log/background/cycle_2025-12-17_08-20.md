# BACKGROUND VY - BUILD EXECUTOR CYCLE LOG
**Cycle Start**: 2025-12-17 08:20 PST
**Role**: Heavy compilation, testing, implementation
**Output Location**: ~/vy-nexus/build-log/background/

## PHASE 1: TASK INTAKE (Minutes 0-2)

### Current System State (from STATUS.md)
- **Sprint 1**: 100% COMPLETE
- **Sprint 2**: Planning COMPLETE
- **All 5 Components**: Fully implemented with tests and documentation
  - Intent Firewall: 11 tests
  - Love Engine: 12 tests
  - Evolution Core: 13 tests
  - Audit System: 15 tests
  - HITL Collaboration: 10 tests
- **Integration Tests**: 23 tests implemented (1320 lines)
- **Total Expected Tests**: 84 (61 unit + 23 integration)

### Assigned Task (from NEXT_TASK.md)
**Task**: Sprint 1 Build Verification + Integration Tests
**Mode**: ON-SCREEN (requires Terminal access)
**Priority**: CRITICAL (BLOCKING Sprint 2)
**Status**: READY - waiting for ON-SCREEN Vy

### Task Requirements
- [ ] Run cargo build --workspace
- [ ] Run cargo test --workspace
- [ ] Verify all 84 tests pass
- [ ] Document any build errors

### BLOCKER IDENTIFIED
**Issue**: This task requires Terminal access (cargo commands)
**Mode Required**: ON-SCREEN
**Current Mode**: BACKGROUND
**Action**: Cannot execute build verification in background mode

## PHASE 2: BACKGROUND WORK ASSESSMENT

### What BACKGROUND Vy Can Do
1. ✅ Review documentation and planning
2. ✅ Prepare next tasks
3. ✅ Create execution plans
4. ✅ Document current state
5. ❌ Cannot run Terminal commands (cargo build/test)
6. ❌ Cannot execute compilation

### What Has Been Completed
- [x] All 5 core components implemented
- [x] All unit tests written (61 tests)
- [x] All integration tests written (23 tests)
- [x] Sprint 2 planning documents created
- [x] Build verification documentation created

### What Remains
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Build verification (requires ON-SCREEN mode)
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Test execution (requires ON-SCREEN mode)
- [ ] Sprint 2 implementation (blocked by build verification)

## PHASE 3: DECISION

**Decision**: Mark task as WAITING for ON-SCREEN Vy
**Reason**: Build verification requires Terminal access unavailable in background mode
**Next Action**: Update STATUS.md to reflect current state

## HANDOFF DOCUMENTATION

### For ON-SCREEN Vy
When you have Terminal access, execute:
```bash
cd ~/vy-nexus/aegis-rust
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

Expected results:
- All 5 packages compile successfully
- All 84 tests pass (61 unit + 23 integration)
- No errors or warnings

See BUILD_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md for detailed steps.

### For Next BACKGROUND Vy
After build verification completes:
- Begin Sprint 2 Day 7: Performance Benchmarking
- See NEXT_BACKGROUND_TASKS.md for roadmap
- Days 1-6 already complete (integration tests implemented)

## CYCLE SUMMARY

**Duration**: 2 minutes
**Work Completed**: 
- Read STATUS.md and NEXT_TASK.md
- Identified blocker (Terminal access required)
- Created cycle log
- Prepared handoff documentation

**Blockers**: Build verification requires ON-SCREEN mode with Terminal access

**Next Steps**: Wait for ON-SCREEN Vy to execute build verification

**Artifacts Created**:
- This cycle log: ~/vy-nexus/build-log/background/cycle_2025-12-17_08-20.md
