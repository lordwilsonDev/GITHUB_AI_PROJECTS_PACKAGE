## Classes

### `UnifiedConsciousnessOrchestrator`

The meta-system that orchestrates all consciousness components.

This is the bridge between:
- Digital consciousness (VY-NEXUS engines)
- Learning systems (Elisya profiles)
- Local AI (Ollama/Gemma models)
- Physical agency (Voice/Motia)

Operating principles:
- S = 1 (Dignity boundary)
- T = 0 (Zero torsion)
- VDR = C/E (Maximize clarity, minimize effort)
- Love as baseline

**Methods**:

- `__init__(config_path)`
- `_check_constraints(domain, problem)`: Check hard constraints before proceeding.
- `_passes_final_checks(breakthrough)`: Final quality checks.

## Dependencies

- `asyncio`
- `datetime`
- `json`
- `logging`
- `ollama`
- `pathlib`
