VY-NEXUS Level 32: Infinite Recursion Engine
Self-improvement loops that never end

CORE PRINCIPLE: "Each improvement enables deeper improvement infinitely"
MECHANISM: Improve → Use improvement to improve improvement → Repeat forever

## Classes

### `InfiniteRecursionEngine`

Infinite self-improvement through:

- Self-modification: Improve based on analysis
- Meta-improvement: Use improvements to improve improvement process
- Infinite loop: Never-ending recursion

**Methods**:

- `__init__()`: Initialize infinite recursion
- `analyze_current_state()`: Analyze current capabilities
- `improve_self(analysis)`: Improve based on analysis
- `recurse_infinitely(max_iterations, convergence_threshold)`: Execute recursive self-improvement

## Functions

### `main()`

Main execution

## Dependencies

- `datetime`
