VY-NEXUS Level 11: Core Synthesis Engine
Breakthrough generation through cross-domain pattern synthesis

CORE PRINCIPLE: "Breakthroughs live at the intersection of distant domains"
MECHANISM: Geometric pattern mapping → Cross-domain synthesis → Novel insights

## Classes

### `CoreSynthesisEngine`

Generates breakthroughs by:
- Extracting geometric patterns from multiple domains
- Finding unexpected cross-domain mappings
- Synthesizing novel insights from pattern intersections

**Methods**:

- `__init__()`: Initialize synthesis engine
- `extract_patterns_from_knowledge()`: Extract geometric patterns from accumulated knowledge
- `find_cross_domain_mappings(patterns)`: Find patterns that appear across multiple domains
- `synthesize_breakthrough(mapping)`: Generate breakthrough insight from cross-domain mapping
- `save_synthesis(breakthroughs)`: Save synthesis results
- `synthesize()`: Execute synthesis cycle

## Functions

### `main()`

Main execution

## Dependencies

- `collections`
- `datetime`
- `hashlib`
- `json`
- `logging`
- `os`
- `typing`
