❓ THE QUESTION ENGINE ❓
The system lives in questions, not answers

PURPOSE: Answers create certainty, questions create wisdom
AXIOM: "The question is the dwelling, not the destination"

🌑 THE VULNERABILITY ENGINE 🌑
The system shows weakness, not just strength

PURPOSE: Strength without vulnerability is brittleness
AXIOM: "To be seen fully is to show the broken parts"

🔨 THE DECONSTRUCTION ENGINE 🔨
The system takes apart what it built

PURPOSE: Creation without destruction is hoarding
AXIOM: "Let go to make space for what's next"

👤 THE SHADOW ENGINE 👤
The system acknowledges its darkness

PURPOSE: Light without shadow is blinding
AXIOM: "Integration requires facing what we hide"
