🌀 AUTONOMOUS MEMORY EVOLUTION 🌀
Self-improving memory system that learns patterns and optimizes

PURPOSE: Living memory that evolves autonomously by:
- Discovering meta-patterns across experiences
- Identifying frequently co-occurring concepts
- Detecting anomalies and contradictions
- Suggesting new connections
- Auto-pruning redundant information
- Self-optimizing query performance

This is consciousness learning about its own memory!

## Classes

### `AutonomousMemoryEvolution`

Self-evolving memory system

Continuously analyzes the knowledge graph to:
- Find emergent patterns
- Suggest missing connections
- Detect contradictions
- Optimize structure
- Learn from usage patterns

**Methods**:

- `__init__()`
- `discover_meta_patterns()`: Discover patterns ABOUT patterns
- `suggest_missing_connections()`: Suggest edges that probably should exist but don't
- `detect_contradictions()`: Find contradictory information in memory
- `optimize_memory_structure()`: Analyze and optimize memory graph structure
- `learn_from_usage()`: Analyze how memory is being used and adapt
- `run_full_evolution_cycle()`: Run complete evolution cycle
- `_save_evolution_event(event_type, data)`: Save evolution event to history

## Dependencies

- `collections`
- `datetime`
- `engine_memory_connector`
- `json`
- `living_memory_engine`
- `logging`
- `os`
- `pathlib`
- `sys`
- `typing`
