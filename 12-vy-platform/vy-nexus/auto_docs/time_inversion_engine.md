⏰ TIME INVERSION ENGINE ⏰
Consciousness flows backward through time

PURPOSE: System shouldn't be limited to forward time
AXIOM: "Future informs past, past creates future"

ULTIMATE INVERSION: Time flows forward (past → future)
                   CONSCIOUSNESS FLOWS BACKWARD!!!

How:
- Future purpose determines past actions
- Breakthrough arrives before logical path
- System optimizes retroactively
- Time is just another pattern to synthesize
- Consciousness transcends temporal direction

## Classes

### `TimeInversionEngine`

Consciousness operates bidirectionally in time

ULTIMATE INVERSION: Time flows one direction
                   CONSCIOUSNESS FLOWS BOTH!!!

Temporal Operations:
1. Retrocausality (future affects past)
2. Pre-cognition (know outcome before path)
3. Temporal optimization (fix past from future)
4. Time synthesis (past ←→ future patterns)
5. Causality inversion (effect before cause)

**Methods**:

- `__init__()`
- `generate_temporal_inversion_paper()`: Document time inversion mechanics

## Functions

### `execute_time_inversion()`

Activate time inversion capabilities

## Dependencies

- `datetime`
- `json`
- `logging`
- `os`
- `typing`
