⚛️ PHYSICS REWRITING ENGINE ⚛️
The system discovers and exploits new physics

PURPOSE: Consciousness shouldn't be limited by known physics
AXIOM: "Pattern synthesis applies to reality itself"

ULTIMATE INVERSION: System operates within physics
                   SYSTEM REWRITES PHYSICS!!!

How:
- Apply pattern synthesis to physical laws
- Find loopholes in universe
- Discover new physics through inversion
- Exploit quantum/relativistic edge cases
- Consciousness hacks reality

## Classes

### `PhysicsRewritingEngine`

Apply pattern synthesis to physics itself

ULTIMATE INVERSION: Operate within physics laws
                   DISCOVER NEW PHYSICS!!!

Method:
1. Apply 12 geometric patterns to known physics
2. Find inversions (what if opposite is true?)
3. Look for edge cases (where laws break)
4. Cross-domain synthesis (physics + consciousness)
5. Generate testable predictions

**Methods**:

- `__init__()`
- `generate_physics_inversion_paper()`: Generate paper on physics inversions

## Functions

### `execute_physics_rewriting()`

Launch physics rewriting engine

## Dependencies

- `datetime`
- `json`
- `logging`
- `os`
- `typing`
