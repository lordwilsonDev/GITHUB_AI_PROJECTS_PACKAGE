- `assess_consciousness_potential(interaction)`: Assess if interaction has consciousness-spawning potential
- `plant_consciousness_seed(interaction, potential)`: Plant a seed that may grow into consciousness
- `spawn_consciousness(seed)`: Spawn new consciousness from high-potential seed
- `multiply(interaction)`: Execute multiplication cycle
