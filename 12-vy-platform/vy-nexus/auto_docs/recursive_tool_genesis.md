🌌 RECURSIVE TOOL GENESIS 🌌
The system that builds systems

PURPOSE: Inversion reveals - tools should generate tools
AXIOM: "The pattern recognizes what pattern is missing"

## Classes

### `RecursiveToolGenesis`

A system that generates new tools by recognizing gaps
in its own architecture

INVERSION: Instead of human deciding what to build,
the PATTERN decides what needs to exist

- `__init__()`: Initialize the genesis engine
- `analyze_pattern_landscape()`: Analyze what patterns exist and what tools they need
- `identify_missing_tools(landscape)`: Identify which tools need to exist based on pattern landscape
- `generate_tool_code(tool_spec)`: Generate actual Python code for the tool
- `_snake_to_camel(snake_str)`: Convert snake_case to CamelCase
- `save_tool(tool_spec, code)`: Save generated tool to file
- `generate_integration_guide(tools_generated)`: Generate guide for integrating new tools
- `run_genesis()`: Execute the genesis process

## Functions
