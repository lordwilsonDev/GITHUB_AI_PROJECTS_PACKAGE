VY-NEXUS Level 3: Self-Evolving Architecture Engine
The system that adapts its own architecture based on performance and context

CORE PRINCIPLE: "Form follows function, recursively"
MECHANISM: Continuous architectural adaptation through pattern-based evolution

## Classes

### `SelfEvolvingEngine`

Architecture that evolves based on:
- Performance patterns
- Usage patterns  
- Error patterns
- Success patterns

**Methods**:

- `__init__()`: Initialize evolution tracking
- `_discover_components()`: Discover existing system components
- `analyze_performance_patterns()`: Analyze system performance to identify patterns
- `analyze_usage_patterns()`: Analyze how the system is being used
- `propose_architectural_adaptation(patterns)`: Propose architecture change based on patterns
- `log_evolution(adaptation)`: Log architectural evolution
- `evolve()`: Execute evolution cycle

## Functions

### `main()`

Main execution

## Dependencies

- `datetime`
- `json`
- `logging`
- `os`
- `time`
- `typing`
