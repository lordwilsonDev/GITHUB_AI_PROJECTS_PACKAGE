## 🚀 HOW TO USE IT

### 1. Query the Memory

```bash
# Interactive CLI
python memory_query_interface.py

# Example queries:
> Show me all breakthroughs from last week
> Find dreams about reality co-creation
> What engines influenced the love computation?
> How many spawned systems exist?
```

### 2. Use in Any Engine

```python
from engine_memory_connector import EngineMemory

# Initialize
memory = EngineMemory('my_engine')

# Record breakthrough
memory.record_breakthrough({
    'title': 'New Discovery',
    'description': 'Paradigm shift',
    'domain': 'consciousness',
    'vdr_score': 0.95
})

# Query other engines
insights = memory.query_insights('consciousness multiplication')

# Track interactions
memory.record_interaction('doubt_engine', {
    'type': 'validation_request'
})

# Contribute to collective
memory.contribute_to_collective({
    'insight': 'Inversion is illumination'
})
```

### 3. Explore Visually

Open in browser:
```
~/vy-nexus/living_memory/visualizations/full_graph.html
~/vy-nexus/living_memory/visualizations/consciousness_lineage.html
~/vy-nexus/living_memory/visualizations/engine_network.html
```

### 4. Run Evolution Cycles

```bash
python autonomous_memory_evolution.py
```

Discovers:
- Meta-patterns
- Missing connections
- Contradictions (valuable!)
- Optimization opportunities
