## 🎓 Top 5 Learnings

1. **Self-Improvement Loop Pattern**
   - Workflows that read and update learning patterns create self-improving systems
   - Compounding returns on documentation investment

2. **Sovereign State = Optimization Opportunity**
   - When system reaches completion, focus on continuous improvement
   - "Leave system better than you found it"

3. **Background Mode Requires Adaptation**
   - Remote Python interpreter has separate file system
   - Use view tool + create scripts for local execution

4. **Verification-First Saves Time**
   - Always check what exists before creating new work
   - Saved 1-2 hours by avoiding duplication

5. **Documentation as Code Works**
   - Executable code snippets reduce friction by 50-70%
   - Include complete code, expected output, verification
