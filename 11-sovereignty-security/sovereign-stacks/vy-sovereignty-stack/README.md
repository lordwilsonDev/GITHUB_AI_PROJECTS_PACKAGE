# 🛡️ VY SOVEREIGNTY STACK

**The Cage Before the Tiger**  
Dynamic Self-Imposed Enclosure (DSIE) Architecture for M1/M2/M3

## 🎯 What This Is

A complete sovereignty stack where **governance exists before cognition**. No model runs without passing through constitutional enforcement. All I/O flows through cryptographic verification. Performance is sovereignty. Simplicity is immortality.

Built for Apple Silicon. Optimized for M1/M2/M3's unified memory architecture.

## 📐 Architecture Philosophy

1. **The Constitution** - Immutable principles that govern everything
2. **Omni-Kernel** - DSIE core that enforces governance before cognition
3. **Synapse** - Cryptographic router that all I/O flows through
4. **Empty Chair Guard** - Prevents any model from running without sovereignty
5. **Zero-Copy Geometry** - M1-optimized for pure performance
6. **Holographic Synapse** - Automatically fixes integrity violations
7. **Epigenetic Scrubber** - Removes complexity creep to stay immortal

**Core Principle:** The cage must exist before the tiger can exist.

## 🚀 Quick Start

You're already in the right place! This directory has:
- omni-kernel.step.ts (DSIE core)
- .synapse.js (I/O router)
- nano_cli.cjs (CLI interface)

### Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Make CLI executable
chmod +x nano_cli.cjs

# 2. Initialize Node.js if needed
npm init -y
npm install typescript @types/node

# 3. Test the stack
./nano_cli.cjs status
```

## 🎛️ Using the CLI

```bash
# Check sovereignty status
./nano_cli.cjs status

# List available models
./nano_cli.cjs list

# Invoke a model (with governance)
./nano_cli.cjs invoke sonnet-4 "Your prompt"
```

## 💡 Philosophy

**The Constitution Is Law** - Not guidelines. Violations halt the system.

**The Cage Before the Tiger** - Governance exists before cognition.

**M1 Is a Sovereignty Multiplier** - Unified memory = zero-copy = fast

**Simplicity Is Immortality** - Systems age through accumulation, scrub aggressively

The cage exists so the tiger can be truly free.

**Build sovereign. Stay sovereign. Be sovereign.**

🛡️ **The cage exists before the tiger.** 🐅
