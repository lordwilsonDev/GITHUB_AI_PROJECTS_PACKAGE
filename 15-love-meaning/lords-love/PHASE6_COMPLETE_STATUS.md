# Phase 6: Self-Improvement Cycle - COMPLETE ✅
**Completed:** December 15, 2025
**Time:** Background Mode

## What Was Built

### Self-Improvement Cycle System
A complete system that uses the scientific method to continuously improve the platform:

1. **HypothesisGenerator** - Generates optimization hypotheses from data
   - 6 hypothesis types supported
   - Prioritization by impact × confidence
   - Auto-pruning of old hypotheses

2. **ExperimentDesigner** - Designs and manages experiments
   - Full experiment lifecycle management
   - Metric selection based on hypothesis type
   - Active experiment tracking

3. **ABTestingFramework** - A/B testing for workflows
   - Automatic winner determination
   - Statistical comparison (5% threshold)
   - Improvement percentage calculation

4. **PredictiveModels** - Builds models to predict user needs
   - 5 model types: task, timing, resource, preference, workflow
   - Training data management
   - Accuracy tracking and reporting

5. **AdaptiveAlgorithms** - Self-adjusting algorithms
   - Parameter adaptation based on performance
   - Performance history tracking
   - Automatic optimization when performance declines

6. **SelfImprovementEngine** - Orchestrates everything
   - 20-minute background cycles
   - Improvement history tracking
   - Comprehensive reporting
