# Starting Phase 10: Predictive Optimization
**Started:** December 15, 2025
**Time:** Background Mode

## What Will Be Built
Predictive Optimization System with 6 components:

1. **NeedsAnticipationSystem** - Predicts user needs before they arise
2. **ProactiveSuggestionEngine** - Suggests improvements proactively
3. **TimingOptimizer** - Optimizes timing for activities
4. **ResourceForecaster** - Forecasts resource requirements
5. **ImpactModeler** - Models impact of changes
6. **PredictiveOptimizationEngine** - Orchestrates all components
