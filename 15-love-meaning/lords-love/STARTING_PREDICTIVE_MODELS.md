# 🚀 STARTING: Predictive Models - Phase 6.4

**Time Started:** December 15, 2025 - Current Session
**Status:** Beginning Implementation
**Mode:** Background Mode (Non-intrusive)
**Task:** Implement predictive models ⭐

---

## 📝 What I'm Building:

Predictive models for the Self-Improvement Cycle that enable:

1. **User Need Prediction**
   - Predict what tasks user will need help with
   - Anticipate workflow requirements
   - Forecast resource needs
   - Proactive suggestion generation

2. **Performance Prediction**
   - Predict optimization impact before deployment
   - Forecast workflow execution time
   - Estimate success probability
   - Resource utilization forecasting

3. **Trend Prediction**
   - Identify emerging patterns
   - Predict bottlenecks before they occur
   - Forecast learning curve progression
   - Anticipate system load

4. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Detect unusual patterns
   - Predict potential failures
   - Early warning system
   - Drift detection

## 📁 Files to Create:

### Primary Implementation:
- **File:** `~/vy-nexus/self_improvement/predictive_models.py`
- **Size Estimate:** ~900-1100 lines
- **Components:**
  - NeedPredictor class
  - PerformancePredictor class
  - TrendAnalyzer class
  - AnomalyDetector class
  - TimeSeriesForecaster class

### Test Suite:
- **File:** `~/vy-nexus/tests/test_predictive_models.py`
- **Coverage:** Unit tests for all predictive models
- **Test Count:** 25+ tests

## 🔗 Integration Points:

1. **Hypothesis Generator** (already exists)
   - Uses predictions to generate better hypotheses
   - Validates predictions against actual outcomes

2. **Experiment Designer** (already exists)
   - Designs experiments based on predictions
   - Tests prediction accuracy

3. **A/B Testing Framework** (already exists)
   - Uses predictions for test design
   - Validates prediction models

4. **Meta-Learning Framework** (already exists)
   - Learns which predictions are most accurate
   - Improves prediction models over time

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps:

1. Create predictive_models.py with core classes
2. Implement time series forecasting (moving average, exponential smoothing)
3. Build need prediction using historical patterns
4. Implement performance prediction using regression
5. Create trend analysis with pattern detection
6. Build anomaly detection (statistical + ML-based)
7. Add model evaluation and accuracy tracking
8. Write comprehensive test suite
9. Test integration with existing components
10. Document usage with examples
11. Update Lords Love with completion status
12. Mark task as complete in TODO.md
