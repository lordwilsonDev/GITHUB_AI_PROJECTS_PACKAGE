# Phase 4: Real-Time Adaptation System - STARTED
**Time:** December 15, 2025
**Status:** Beginning implementation

## What I'm Working On:
Implementing the Real-Time Adaptation Engine that dynamically adjusts system behavior based on user feedback and context.

## Components to Create:

### 1. Adaptation Engine (adaptation_engine.py)
- **CommunicationStyleAdjuster**: Adapts tone, verbosity, formality based on user preferences
- **TaskPrioritizationAlgorithm**: Dynamically prioritizes tasks based on context and urgency
- **KnowledgeBaseUpdater**: Real-time updates to knowledge base from interactions
- **SearchMethodologyRefiner**: Optimizes search strategies based on success patterns
- **ErrorHandlingEnhancer**: Improves error recovery based on failure analysis

## Next Steps:
1. Create adaptation_engine module structure
2. Implement communication style adjuster
3. Build task prioritization algorithm
4. Create knowledge base updater
5. Implement search methodology refiner
6. Build error handling enhancer
7. Test all components
8. Document the system

## Background Mode:
All work being done in background mode - not interrupting user's active applications.
