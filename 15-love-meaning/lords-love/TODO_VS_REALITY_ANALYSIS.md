# TODO vs Reality Analysis

## The Problem:
The TODO.md in memory shows Phases 4-15 as INCOMPLETE, but actual files exist for many of these phases.

## What TODO Says:
- Phase 1-3: Complete ✅
- Phase 4: NOT complete (first unchecked: "Build feedback analysis system")
- Phase 5: NOT complete
- Phase 6: Partially complete (hypothesis_generator, experiment_designer done)

## What Actually Exists (verified via file system):

### Phase 4 Files Found:
- communication_adapter.py (709 lines) ✅
- task_prioritizer.py ✅
- knowledge_base_updater.py ✅
- search_methodology_refiner.py ✅
- enhanced_error_handler.py ✅

### Phase 5 Files Found:
- deployment_pipeline.py ✅
- meta_learning_framework.py ✅
- workflow_template_updater.py ✅
- PHASE5_COMPLETE.md exists ✅

### Phase 6 Files Found:
- hypothesis_generator.py ✅
- experiment_designer.py (709 lines) ✅

## Conclusion:
The TODO.md needs to be updated to reflect actual completion state.

## Action Required:
1. Update TODO.md to mark Phase 4 as complete
2. Update TODO.md to mark Phase 5 as complete  
3. Continue with Phase 6 next component (A/B Testing Framework)

## Note:
The "Build feedback analysis system" is actually part of communication_adapter.py which already exists and is complete.
