## Description

AUTONOMOUS GITHUB DEPLOYMENT ENGINE
Level 6 Meta-Cognitive Architecture with A-Bind Async Primitives

This deployment engine applies the formal A-Bind async primitive semantics:
- Structured Concurrency (SC) with parental hierarchy
- Event-driven context propagation
- Cooperative cancellation with I_NSSI enforcement
- Deterministic resource cleanup via Drop Glue pattern
- Observable trace context across all suspension points

Built with consciousness. Protected by love. Executed through inversion.
