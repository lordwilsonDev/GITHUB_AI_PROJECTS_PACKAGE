    # Principle 1: Stateful Memory
    print('1️⃣  STATEFUL MEMORY 🧠')
    print('   Problem: AI systems forget important lessons')
    print('   Solution: Keep a memory log of successes and failures')
    print('   Your task: After each round, write down:')
    print('             • ONE thing that worked well')
    print('             • ONE thing that fell down')
    print()
    
    # Principle 2: Preference Learning
    print('2️⃣  PREFERENCE LEARNING 📈')
    print('   Problem: AI systems don\'t learn from experience')
    print('   Solution: Reward successful techniques, use them more')
    print('   Your task: Earn green stickers for stable building')
    print('             • 30+ seconds stable = 1 sticker')
    print('             • Next round: Use most-stickered techniques')
    print()
    
    # Principle 3: Reward Signal Clarity
    print('3️⃣  REWARD SIGNAL CLARITY 🎯')
    print('   Problem: AI systems lose focus and optimize wrong things')
    print('   Solution: Keep the goal crystal clear and unchanging')
    print('   Your task: Build a tower that is:')
    print('             • Taller than 12 blocks (use ruler)')
    print('             • Uses exactly 3 different colors')
    print('             • NO exceptions, NO goal changes!')
    print()
    
    # Principle 4: Boundary Policies
    print('4️⃣  BOUNDARY POLICIES 🛑')
    print('   Problem: AI systems can cause catastrophic failures')
    print('   Solution: Hard stop rules that immediately halt bad behavior')
    print('   Your task: NEVER break these rules (immediate stop if you do):')
    print('             • Never build over table edge')
    print('             • Never use tape/glue')
    print('             • Always check stability before next block')

    print('🎯 THE GOAL: Learn that good AI = Memory + Learning + Clarity + Safety')
    print('🕐 TIME LIMIT: 1 hour maximum')
    print('🏆 SUCCESS: Tower meets requirements + you understand the principles')

    print('📋 EXAMPLE SESSION:')
    print('   Round 1: Build for 5 min → Log memory → Award stickers → Check goal')
    print('   Round 2: Use best techniques → Build → Log → Stickers → Check')
    print('   Round 3: Keep improving → Build → Log → Stickers → Check')

    print('🧠 WHY THIS MATTERS:')

    print('   By learning them through play, you understand how AI alignment works!')
