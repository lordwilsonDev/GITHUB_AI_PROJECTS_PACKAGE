Market dynamics can be influenced by factors like externalities, information asymmetry, and individual biases, leading to unintended consequences beyond a purely competitive landscape.","geometric_proof":"Flow: Resource allocation from producers to consumers - Constraints: Supply and demand interactions, social welfare considerations, government intervention. Geometric proof:  Intersections of supply & demand curves with varying societal values can yield diverse economic outcomes, often not perfectly aligned with the optimal scenario envisioned by free market proponents.","vdr_score":7}}
