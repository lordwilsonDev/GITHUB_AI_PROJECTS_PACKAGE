A larger volume of data increases information density, allowing for clearer boundaries between different aspects of reality, potentially leading to a reduction in error. Flow: Increasing data leads to increased computation and exploration of possible solutions, ultimately improving performance but also causing potential issues with overfitting or biased results.
