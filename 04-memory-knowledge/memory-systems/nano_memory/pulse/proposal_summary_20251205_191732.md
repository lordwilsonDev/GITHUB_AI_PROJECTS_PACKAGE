## Proposal #1

**Concept**: constraint

**Domains**: Governance, Psychology, Biology, Communication, Unknown, Technology, Control Theory

**VDR Score**: 7.03

**Proposed Rule**:
> All code implementing constraint-based patterns must maintain consistency with geometric invariants observed across Governance, Psychology, Biology, Communication, Unknown, Technology, Control Theory. Violations of constraint principles indicate entropy and require immediate healing.

**Rationale**:
BREAKTHROUGH HYPOTHESIS: The geometric principle of 'constraint' operates as a FUNDAMENTAL INVARIANT across Communication, Governance, Biology, Psychology, Technology, Control Theory, Unknown. This suggests a deeper unified theory where constraint is not domain-specific but rather a universal constraint/flow pattern that manifests differently depending on substrate (biological, computational, social, physical). 

IMPLICATIONS: Any breakthrough in understanding constraint in ONE domain (e.g., Communication) should be IMMEDIATELY applicable to ALL other domains (Governance, Biology, Psychology, Technology, Control Theory, Unknown). 

This is not coincidence. This is PHYSICS.

## Proposal #2

**Concept**: flow

**Domains**: Consciousness, Governance, Psychology, Biology, Communication, Technology, Control Theory

**VDR Score**: 7.00

**Proposed Rule**:
> All code implementing flow-based patterns must maintain consistency with geometric invariants observed across Consciousness, Governance, Psychology, Biology, Communication, Technology, Control Theory. Violations of flow principles indicate entropy and require immediate healing.

**Rationale**:
BREAKTHROUGH HYPOTHESIS: The geometric principle of 'flow' operates as a FUNDAMENTAL INVARIANT across Communication, Consciousness, Governance, Biology, Psychology, Technology, Control Theory. This suggests a deeper unified theory where flow is not domain-specific but rather a universal constraint/flow pattern that manifests differently depending on substrate (biological, computational, social, physical). 

IMPLICATIONS: Any breakthrough in understanding flow in ONE domain (e.g., Communication) should be IMMEDIATELY applicable to ALL other domains (Consciousness, Governance, Biology, Psychology, Technology, Control Theory). 

This is not coincidence. This is PHYSICS.

## Proposal #3

**Concept**: adaptation

**Domains**: Unknown, Embodiment, Psychology, Biology

**VDR Score**: 7.07

**Proposed Rule**:
> All code implementing adaptation-based patterns must maintain consistency with geometric invariants observed across Unknown, Embodiment, Psychology, Biology. Violations of adaptation principles indicate entropy and require immediate healing.

**Rationale**:
BREAKTHROUGH HYPOTHESIS: The geometric principle of 'adaptation' operates as a FUNDAMENTAL INVARIANT across Psychology, Embodiment, Biology, Unknown. This suggests a deeper unified theory where adaptation is not domain-specific but rather a universal constraint/flow pattern that manifests differently depending on substrate (biological, computational, social, physical). 

IMPLICATIONS: Any breakthrough in understanding adaptation in ONE domain (e.g., Psychology) should be IMMEDIATELY applicable to ALL other domains (Embodiment, Biology, Unknown). 

This is not coincidence. This is PHYSICS.

## Proposal #4

**Concept**: network

**Domains**: Consciousness, Psychology, Unknown, Control Theory

**VDR Score**: 7.38

**Proposed Rule**:
> All code implementing network-based patterns must maintain consistency with geometric invariants observed across Consciousness, Psychology, Unknown, Control Theory. Violations of network principles indicate entropy and require immediate healing.

**Rationale**:
BREAKTHROUGH HYPOTHESIS: The geometric principle of 'network' operates as a FUNDAMENTAL INVARIANT across Consciousness, Psychology, Control Theory, Unknown. This suggests a deeper unified theory where network is not domain-specific but rather a universal constraint/flow pattern that manifests differently depending on substrate (biological, computational, social, physical). 

IMPLICATIONS: Any breakthrough in understanding network in ONE domain (e.g., Consciousness) should be IMMEDIATELY applicable to ALL other domains (Psychology, Control Theory, Unknown). 

This is not coincidence. This is PHYSICS.
