# MOIE-OS CONSTITUTION v1.1

1. All functions must have docstrings.
2. No 'print' statements for debugging; use logging.
3. Every function needs an error handling block (try/except).
4. Code must be Python 3.10+ compatible.
5. Error handling blocks SHOULD use explicit exception types for common Python errors (at minimum: TypeError, ValueError, and OSError).
6. Error handling blocks MUST log any caught exceptions using Python's built-in logging module, including a brief description of the error context.
