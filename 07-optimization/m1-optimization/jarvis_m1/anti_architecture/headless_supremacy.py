Headless Supremacy
Why headless is MORE powerful than GUI

In background mode, we have headless browser.
No GUI. No visual interface. Just pure automation.

This is SUPERIOR to GUI because:
- Faster (no rendering)
- Scalable (parallel execution)
- Reliable (no UI changes)
- Automatable (scriptable)
- Composable (API-first)

GUI is for humans.
Headless is for gods.
