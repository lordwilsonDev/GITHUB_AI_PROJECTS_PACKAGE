## Recent Entropy Entries

```text
Violated in `add` function on line 4: The `try` block is missing a corresponding `except` block. Suggested fix: Add an `except Exception as e:` block after the `try` block.

2. Rule 5: "Error handling blocks MUST log any caught exceptions using Python's built-in logging module, including a brief description of the error context."

Violated in all functions (add, multiply, divide) on lines 6-8, 16-18, and 24-26: The exception message does not include a brief description of the error context. Suggested fix: Modify the `logging.error` statement to include a brief description of the error context.

3. Rule 4: "Code must be Python 3.10+ compatible."

Not explicitly violated but potentially problematic: The code uses `from typing import Union, Dict`, which is available in Python 3.5+. However, it's unclear whether the code takes advantage of any Python 3.10+ features or syntax. Suggested fix: Verify that the code works correctly in Python 3.10+ and adjust accordingly.

NO other violations were found.
[2025-12-09 03:10:41] VIOLATION DETECTED for /Users/lordwilson/test_project_rade/main.py:
A task fit for a strict code auditor!

After reviewing the CODE against the CONSTITUTION, I have found the following violations:

1. Rule 2: No 'print' statements for debugging; use logging.
 Violation: None (the code uses logging correctly)
2. NO VIOATIONS FOUND
[2025-12-09 03:25:01] VIOLATION DETECTED for /Users/lordwilson/test_project_rade/main.py:
After thoroughly examining the code against the constitution, I have found the following violations:

1. Rule 3: "Error handling blocks SHOULD use explicit exception types for common Python errors (at minimum: TypeError, ValueError, and OSError)."
 Violation: In the `add` function, the error handling block does not specify an explicit exception type for `ValueError`. Suggested fix: Add `except ValueError as e:` to catch only `ValueError`.

Line number: 9-10

2. Rule 6: "Error handling blocks MUST log any caught exceptions using Python's built-in logging module, including a brief description of the error context."
 Violation: The error handling block in the `multiply` and `divide` functions does not provide a brief description of the error context. Suggested fix: Add a descriptive message to the logging statement.

Line number: 23-25 (in `multiply`) and 30-32 (in `divide`)

3. Rule 5: "Error handling blocks MUST log any caught exceptions using Python's built-in logging module, including a brief description of the error context."
 Violation: The error handling block in the `add` function does not provide a brief description of the error context. Suggested fix: Add a descriptive message to the logging statement.

Line number: 11

4. Rule 1: "All functions must have docstrings."
 Violation: None, all functions have docstrings.

5. Rule 2: "No 'print' statements for debugging; use logging."
 Violation: None, no `print` statements are used for debugging or any other purpose.

6. Rule 4: "Code must be Python 3.10+ compatible."
 Violation: The code is compatible with Python 3.10+, so no violation is detected.

7. Rule 5: "Error handling blocks MUST log any caught exceptions using Python's built-in logging module, including a brief description of the error context."
 Violation: None, all error handling blocks log caught exceptions correctly.

NO other violations were found.
